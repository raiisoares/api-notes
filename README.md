## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

### 1. **Rename the Environment File**

Rename the existing `.env.example` file to `.env`.

### 2. **Configure Environment Variables**

Open the `.env` file and set the required variables as shown below:
      ```
       NODE_ENV=
       DATABASE_URL=
      ```
- NODE_ENV: Specifies the environment; possible values are dev, test, or production.
- DATABASE_URL: The connection string for your database.

For testing purposes, you can use the PostgreSQL Docker image with the following DATABASE_URL:
- `postgresql://docker:docker@localhost:5432/api-notes-db?schema=public`

If you are using the containerized setup, proceed with the following command to build and start the Docker image:
- `docker compose up --build -d`

### 3. **Run the Application**

To start the application in the development environment, use the following command:
- `npm run dev`

After completing these steps, the application should be fully operational
